# Day 1: Java Basics

## Introduction to Java
Java is a high-level programming language introduced by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle). It is known for its:

- **Platform Independence**: "Write Once, Run Anywhere" - Java code can run on multiple platforms without modification.
- **Object-Oriented Principles**: Utilizing concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism for modular and maintainable code.
- **Robustness and Security**: Strong memory management, exception handling, and built-in security features for reliable applications.
- **Multithreading**: Facilitates concurrent programming for improved performance.

## Features of Java
1. **Platform Independence**: Java programs can be executed on various platforms using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
2. **Object-Oriented**: Promotes modular and reusable code.
3. **Robust and Secure**: Provides mechanisms to handle errors and ensure secure execution.
4. **Multithreading**: Allows multiple tasks to run concurrently, enhancing performance.

## Java Architecture
### Components:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Tools for compiling, running, and debugging Java programs.
- **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**: Executes Java bytecode and enables platform independence.
- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: Includes JVM and core libraries required to run Java applications.

## Let's Get to Coding
### Creating a Java File:
1. Create a file named `Learning Java`.
2. Open a command prompt in the directory of the file by typing `cmd`.
3. Use the following command to create a Java file:
   ```bash
   notepad MyFirstApp.java
   
  ## Classes, Methods, and Statements

- A Java program must contain at least one **class** and one **main method**.
- The `main` method acts as the entry point for program execution.

## Compilation and Execution

- **Compilation**: The process of converting human-readable Java code (source code) into bytecode using the `javac` compiler.
    ```bash
   javac MyFirstApp.java
   
- **Execution**: Bytecode is interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), allowing the program to run on any platform.
    ```bash
   java MyFirstApp
